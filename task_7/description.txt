# Simulate the “Fishing” game.
#         Create the next classes:
# Pond. It should have the next attributes: capacity – 
# list that contains all fish from the Pond in the current moment;
# state – ‘poor’, ‘normal’, ‘rich’. Pond is ‘poor’ if it’s capacity contains less then 5 fishes,
# ‘normal’, if capacity contains from 5 to 10 fishes, and ‘rich’ 
# if it has more than 10 fishes. Pond can obtainFish() – it will be added to it’s capacity, and lostFish()
# – it will be taken from capacity. The Pond state changes automatically 
# when it’s capacity reaches the appropriate value.
# Pond also allows showPapacity() and showState(). You can also add the optional attributes (as you wish).
# Fish. It has weight.
# Fish has two derived classes: SheatFish and Carp.
# SheatFish should have whisckerLength, Carp should have color.
# You can also add optional attributes (as you wish).
# User should have interactive menu:
# 1.1. View capacity;
# 2.2. View state of Pond;
# 3.3. Add fish( Carp or SheatFish);
# 4.4. Catch fish (concrete instance);
# 5.5. Create new fish (fill himself the creator)))
# 6.6. Finish the game. (edited)
